<h2 align="center">Alon Perlin</h2>

Full-stack developer (backend-leaning) based in Tel Aviv, focused on building **production-grade web systems** with strong security, testing, and CI/CD discipline.

I enjoy owning features end-to-end — from API design and database modeling to frontend integration and deployment.

### Primary Project

#### ChatSVG (Beta)

Production-oriented SaaS for generating structured SVG assets from text prompts.
This is my primary ongoing project, built as a real system with security, testing, and deployment practices aligned with commercial products.

#### Key highlights

- Secure authentication system with JWT access tokens, rotating refresh tokens (reuse detection), and CSRF protection

- Backend-first architecture focused on correctness, isolation, and scalability

- Robust CI/CD pipeline enforcing quality gates:

  - Backend unit and integration tests (Jest)
  - End-to-end tests provisioning frontend, backend, and database (Playwright)
  - Branch protection with required checks before merge

- Production deployments with observability:

  - Frontend on Vercel
  - Backend API on Render
  - Centralized logging (Pino) and error tracking (Sentry)

- Designed to support future billing, quotas, and subscription tiers

#### Technology stack
TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL (Neon), React, Vite, Jest, Playwright, GitHub Actions
