## Alon Perlin

Full-stack developer (backend-leaning) based in Tel Aviv, focused on building **production-grade web systems** with strong security, testing, and CI/CD discipline.

I enjoy owning features end-to-end — from API design and database modeling to frontend integration and deployment.

## Primary Project

### ChatSVG (Beta)

- Backend-first architecture (Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL / Neon)
- Full CI/CD pipeline:
  - Backend tests (Jest)
  - End-to-end tests (Playwright)
  - Branch protection and gated merges
- Production deployments (Vercel for frontend, Render for backend)
- Designed for future payments, usage limits, and subscriptions

**Stack**  
TypeScript, Node.js, Express, Prisma, PostgreSQL, React, Vite, Playwright, Jest, GitHub Actions
